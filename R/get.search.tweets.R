#' get_search_tweets
#'
#' Returns a collection of relevant Tweets matching a specified query.
#' Please note that Twitter’s search service and, by extension, the Search API is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets. Not all Tweets will be indexed or made available via the search interface.
#' In API v1.1, the response format of the Search API has been improved to return Tweet objects more similar to the objects you’ll find across the REST API and platform. However, perspectival attributes (fields that pertain to the perspective of the authenticating user) are not currently supported on this endpoint.
#' To learn how to use Twitter Search effectively, consult our guide to Using the Twitter Search API. See Working with Timelines to learn best practices for navigating results by since_id and max_id.
#'
#' @param q required, A UTF-8, URL-encoded search query of 500 characters maximum, including operators. Queries may additionally be limited by complexity.
#' @param geocode optional, Returns tweets by users located within a given radius of the given latitude/longitude. The location is preferentially taking from the Geotagging API, but will fall back to their Twitter profile. The parameter value is specified by “latitude,longitude,radius”, where radius units must be specified as either “mi” (miles) or “km” (kilometers). Note that you cannot use the near operator via the API to geocode arbitrary locations; however you can use this geocode parameter to search near geocodes directly. A maximum of 1,000 distinct “sub-regions” will be considered when using the radius modifier.
#' @param lang optional, Restricts tweets to the given language, given by an ISO 639-1 code. Language detection is best-effort.
#' @param locale optional, Specify the language of the query you are sending (only ja is currently effective). This is intended for language-specific consumers and the default should work in the majority of cases.
#' @param result_type optional, Specifies what type of search results you would prefer to receive. The current default is “mixed.” Valid values include \code{"mixed"} to nclude both popular and real time results in the response, \code{"recent"} to return only the most recent results in the response, and\code{"popular"} to return only the most popular results in the response.
#' @param count optional, The number of tweets to return per page, up to a maximum of 100. Defaults to 15. This was formerly the “rpp” parameter in the old Search API.
#' @param until optional, Returns tweets created before the given date. Date should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind that the search index has a 7-day limit. In other words, no tweets will be found for a date older than one week. Example Values: \code{"2015-07-19"}.
#' @param since_id optional, Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
#' @param max_id optional, Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to the specified ID.
#' @param include_entities optional, The entities node will be disincluded when set to false.
#' @param callback optional, If supplied, the response will use the JSONP format with a callback of the given name. The usefulness of this parameter is somewhat diminished by the requirement of authentication for requests to this endpoint. Example Values: \code{"processTweets"}
#' @param token OAuth token (1.0 or 2.0)

#' @return json object
