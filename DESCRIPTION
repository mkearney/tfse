Title: Tools for Script Editing
Description: A collection of useful tools for programming and writing-scripts. 
    Several functions are simple wrappers around base R functions that extend 
    their functionality while also providing some convenient propertiesâ€“regular
    expression functions that automatically detect look-ahead and look-behind 
    statements, a read-line function that suppresses incomplete-final-line 
    warnings and automatically opens and closes connections, a version of 
    substrings that starts from the end of strings, etc. Other functions are 
    useful for working with hexadecimal colors, installing packages, omitting 
    missing data, and showing in-use connections.
